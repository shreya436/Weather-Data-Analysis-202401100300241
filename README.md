Weather conditions impact daily life and industries, but analyzing large datasets efficiently is challenging. This project processes weather data, visualizes trends, and builds predictive models for better decision-making.

Objectives

Collect and clean weather data.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Visualize temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation trends.

Develop predictive models for weather forecasting.

Identify correlations between weather parameters.
